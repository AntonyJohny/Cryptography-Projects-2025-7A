Description: 

A secure notepad application that encrypts user data using multiple cryptographic algorithms â€” AES, ECC, and RSA â€” to ensure confidentiality and data integrity. It includes an integrated color palette for personalized note organization and a visually rich interface.
To decrypt and access the original notes, the user must enter the exact same key or credentials used during encryption, providing strong protection against unauthorized access.

Steps to run:

1. npm install          # Install dependencies
2. npm run dev          # Start development server
3. Open localhost:5173  # Access the application
4. Login: demo/password123  # Use demo credentials
5. Create encrypted notes with rainbow colors! ðŸŒˆ
