◦ Brief Description of the Project: This project is a web-based Triple DES (3DES) Encryption and Decryption Tool. It's built using Python Flask for the backend logic and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a clean, two-part user interface.
The main goal of the project is to provide a hands-on demonstration of the strong, three-key symmetric encryption algorithm known as 3DES.The application explicitly takes three separate keys for both encryption and decryption, directly demonstrating the fundamental Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt (EDE) principle of the 3DES algorithm.
