# üîê Hybrid Cloud File Encryption System

This project demonstrates secure file encryption and decryption using AES and SHA-256 cryptography.
It includes:
- Frontend (React)
- Backend (Node.js with Express)
- AES-GCM encryption for confidentiality
- SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification
- LocalStorage persistence for keys and file info

## How to Run
1. Start backend:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
