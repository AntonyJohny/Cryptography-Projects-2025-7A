## Project Description
The **Secure Voting System Using Hybrid Cryptography** is designed to provide a secure and confidential platform for voting.  
It combines **asymmetric (RSA/ECC) and symmetric (AES)** encryption techniques to ensure:  
- **Confidentiality** – Votes cannot be read by unauthorized users  
- **Integrity** – Votes cannot be tampered with  
- **Authentication** – Only registered voters can cast votes  
- **Auditability** – Voting process can be verified without compromising voter privacy  

This project demonstrates the use of hybrid cryptography for a real-world application of secure digital voting.
